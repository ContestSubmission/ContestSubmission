= ContestSubmission

Contest Submission is a submission platform that allows you to submit your files as a team or as an individual. +
This should happen without the server crashing and without long waiting times!

Example: Company ... offers a photo contest and has posted all the required information. +
Now the authorized participants can submit their photo projects by a certain deadline. +
After the deadline, the company / jury will evaluate the submission together with all others directly on the platform.
